## Extract Transform Load (ETL) in Power BI using Power Query Editor

2.	Created relationships between tables using Power BIâ€™s data modelling
3.	Cleaned data\
a)	Sales amount <= 0 in the transaction table, filtered these rows\
b)	INR and USD have extra characters (hidden), cleaned\
c)	Normalized currency to CAD from INR and USD
4.	Applied all transformations and loaded. 

## Measures created using DAX 
1. Total Revenue from 2017-2020: revenue = SUM(transactions[normalized_amount_cad])
2. Total sales quantity from 2017-2020: sales_qty = SUM(transactions[sales_qty])
